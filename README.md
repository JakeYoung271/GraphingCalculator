# GraphingCalculator
This is a program which makes a graph based off of a function inputed by user
This is coded in python and uses the math library as well as matplotlib and numpy. It is heavily annotated with comments and as far as I know, there are no glitches, at least yet.
This is my first project on github and I can't wait for feedback!
